    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Surprise-Driven Learning**: Memory updates based on prediction error\n",
    "2. **Test-Time Training**: Learning happens during inference, not just training\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Architecture**: Frozen LLM + Trainable Memory = Best of both worlds\n",
    "4. **Confidence Scoring**: Know when to trust the memory\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of This Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLM is frozen, so it can't directly use the soft prompts\n",
    "- Semantic memory is simple retrieval, not true neural learning\n",
    "- Production systems need more sophisticated architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scale Up**: Try with Mistral-7B or Llama-3 (use 4-bit quantization!)\n",
    "2. **Soft Prompt Injection**: Actually inject memory into LLM embeddings\n",
    "3. **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Use a second model to verify matches\n",
    "4. **Persistent Memory**: Save/load memory checkpoints\n",
